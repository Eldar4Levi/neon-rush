Neon Rush game development completed with all core features working properly.

## Game Ideas Analysis

### 1. Color Swap üé®

**Core Mechanic**: Ball moves upward, tap to switch colors to pass through color-coded obstacles
**Complexity**: Low-Medium
**Monetization Potential**: High (skins, ads, daily challenges)
**Development Time**: 2-3 weeks
**Addictiveness**: High (simple but engaging)

### 2. Tile Merge Rush üî¢

**Core Mechanic**: Numbered tiles fall like Tetris, merge same numbers (2‚Üí4‚Üí8...)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Monetization Potential**: High (skins, boosts, leaderboard)
**Development Time**: 3-4 weeks
**Addictiveness**: Very High (progressive difficulty, combos)

### 3. Stack Tower üèóÔ∏è

**Core Mechanic**: Drop blocks to build tower, misaligned parts cut off
**Complexity**: Low
**Monetization Potential**: Medium (skins, power-ups)
**Development Time**: 2-3 weeks
**Addictiveness**: High (simple but satisfying)

### 4. Orbit Tap ü™ê

**Core Mechanic**: Dot orbits planet, tap to jump to next orbit, avoid obstacles
**Complexity**: Medium
**Monetization Potential**: High (skins, ads, leaderboard)
